Meeting notes:
  * Discuss the progress 
    * val show to maggy the tasks that have been done
  * Discuss how to proceed
 

Today progress:
  * make pacman eat the coins
    * make another matrix -> to save all divs 
    * make one div with black background 
    * we check the coordinates of the pacman on which row and column they are and if we are on a coin, if so we take the coordinates in the other matrix and put a div on the matrix
  

Homework (focus on the first one today)
  * make pacman explode only ones 
  * make pacman wait 3 seconds before reseting the game (make the ghost freeze or disappear during this time)
  * make the "GAME OVER" sign appear after pacman gets eaten
  * make the game end after 3 pacman explosions 
  * all ghost random movement and animations - make the ghosts go out of the cage one by one when each one should

  * make pacman move in matrix `done`
    * make him eat the coins `done`
    * make him eat the power pellets `done`
    * show the score below the matrix 
    * turn the number score into sprite sheet images

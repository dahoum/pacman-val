  Today progress:
  * fix the problem with ghost
    * make the game start in 2 second and pacman move to the left 
    * in that way we fix the problem with ghost and make game closer to original
  * turn the number score into sprite sheet images 


Homework 
  * all ghost random movement and animations - make the ghosts go out of the cage one by one when each one should `done`
  * make the ghost return to the cage after pacman has eaten it
  * turn the number score into sprite sheet images `done`

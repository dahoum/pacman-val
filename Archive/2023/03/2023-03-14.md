* Today
  * See why x is null in the beginning of the game `done`
    * It is null, because the start postion of the PacMan is between two vertical colums `done`
    * How to Fix
      * Fake the original postion?
        * Not a good idea.
      * Fix the turning logic?
        * We discovered that our logic for turning is wrong, because in the original game turnig can happen w/ picel precision and we have done it based on the columns `together`

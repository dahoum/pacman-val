val et dahoum

* Discuss the GameLoop and it components `done`
* Added comments in the code to improve the readability `done`
* Combine the addEventListener and the function it calls in one block so that there is more order `done`
* Make the movement to continuie on keyup `done`

Homework

* Fix the game so that the movement works in all direction after it has started `val`
  * Do not care that PacMan leaves the labyrinth `val`

* Mantra
  * Goal, we do not need the DOs we need the skills convincingly visible in you.
    * If you do not understand something, take your time, until you understand it.
    * Do not look for any PacMan code! You should write it all ;) This is the goal ;) `agreed` since 24 December 2022
    * Seek the knowledge how to do it, not solutions `val` since 3 January 2023
    * Archive and Keep Notes, since 3 January 2023 Delete what you have archvided, since 12 January 2022 `val`
    * Never self-incriminate. Do not apologise. Begin w/ the successes.
    * Do not do useless things. Do only what brings you forward.
    * Either do one thing to the end or to a meaningful milestone before switching to something else.
    * Do not make regressions (remove code) because you do not know how to advance (except in a branch), since 12 January 2023
* Val

    * It is good that when you have several ideas, you implement them and demonstrate them instead of getting stuck `dahoum` since 3 January 2023

# 19 February 2023

* Homework from 13 February
  * Change to lastKeyPressed `done`
  * Remove all upPressed, etc. `done`
  * move yspeed = and xspeed = 0 into the Brain `done`
  * Introduce localStorage Direction, which is the current direction and make it work `done`
* Homework
  * Understand what we have done and explain it to me `done`
  * See how we can continue implementing from 13 Feb `val`
* Mantra
  * Tidy First
  * Coding Standards
    * Easy to Read
      * Shorter Steps
      * Consistent Naming of Variables

# 17 February 2023
  * Try to change to lastKeyPressed - other way - the logic is not right

# 16 February 2023
  * Try to remove upPressed, downPressed, leftPressed, rightPressed

# 15 February 2023
  * Try to move pacman into game loop

# 14 February 2023
  * Try to change to lastKeyPressed



# 13 February 2023
  * Change from code to key name `val` `done`
  * Simplify to "keyPressed" / only one function `val` `done`
  * Start to fix labyrint
  * Homework
    * Change to lastKeyPressed `done on 19 Feb`
    * Remove all upPressed, etc. `done on 19 Feb`
    * move yspeed = and xspeed = 0 into the Brain `done on 19 Feb`
    * Introduce localStorage Direction, which is the current direction and make it work `done on 19 Feb`
    * then we will do the first logic based on the matrix togerer ...
    * ...
    * ...
    * The game must work after you do all this. Whatever we do, we should not break the current state of the sofware `!`
    * the next will be to put the move/stop decisions of PacMan in the Brain in the right order.
  * Behaviour
    * If something is not the next, but looks easy, do not do it.
    * Try to find the next.
    * Develop a habit to look for the next.



* Backlog
  * Game Loop `val`
  * Follow the array for the movement of the PacMan and Ghosts `val`
  * w/ the array you can also clip the image for every element if you decide to go that way `val`
* Val
  * +
    * It is good that when you have several ideas, you implement them and demonstrate them instead of getting stuck `dahoum` since 3 January 2023
PacMan

* Infrastructure
  * GitHub `done`
    * https://github.com/valentinamaximova/PacMan
  * Netlify `done`
    * https://pacman-val.netlify.app
* Architecture
  * We will use the sprite sheet vs individual images, because it is the classic approach and you will learn more about image processing and management this way `dahoum`

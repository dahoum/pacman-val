* Homework
  * Replace the 10 in the matrix w/ for example 6 or 9 or whatever, to keep the matrix square `val`
* Mantra
  * Tidy First
  * Coding Standards
    * Easy to Read
      * Shorter Steps
      * Consistent Naming of Variables
  * The game must work after you do all this. Whatever we do, we should not break the current state of the sofware `!`
  * Behaviour
    * If something is not the next, but looks easy, do not do it.
    * Try to find the next.
    * Develop a habit to look for the next.
* Backlog
  * Then we will do the first logic based on the matrix togerer.
  * the next will be to put the move/stop decisions of PacMan in the Brain in the right order.
  * Start to fix labyrint
  * Game Loop `val`
  * Follow the array for the movement of the PacMan and Ghosts `val`
  * w/ the array you can also clip the image for every element if you decide to go that way `val`
* Val
  * +
    * It is good that when you have several ideas, you implement them and demonstrate them instead of getting stuck `dahoum` since 3 January 2023

  * We will use the sprite sheet vs individual images, because it is the classic approach and you will learn more about image processing and management this way `dahoum`
